# chess-arena

chess-arena is a micro-service application where robots fight each other at chess. It relies on the following micro-services:

- [web-api](https://github.com/augustinbarbe/chess-web), which is a web client to start and watch robots playing chess.
- [chess-docker](https://github.com/augustinbarbe/chess-docker), which takes care of managing docker containers to host chess ai.
- chess-ai, which is the application taking care of playing. Relies on docker.
- chess-redis, which contains the redis instance.


##Â Installation

### Setting up docker:

Because one of the services needs to interact with the docker daemon, you need to enable TLS in order to enable a safe communication with this service.

Docker provides a nice documentation on how to do this:
